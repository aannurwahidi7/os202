# Top 10 List of Week 08

1. [CPU Scheduling](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/cpu-scheduling)<br>
CPU scheduling is a process which allows one process to use the CPU while the execution of another process is on hold(in waiting state) due to unavailability of any resource like I/O etc, thereby making full use of CPU. The aim of CPU scheduling is to make the system efficient, fast and fair.

2. [What is Spooling in Operating System?](https://afteracademy.com/blog/what-is-spooling-in-operating-system)<br>
Spooling stands for "Simultaneous Peripheral Operations Online". So, in a Spooling, more than one I/O operations can be performed simultaneously i.e. at the time when the CPU is executing some process then more than one I/O operations can also de done at the same time.

3. [Cloud Computing : Cloud Computing Services, Cloud Operating System](https://www.tutorialsweb.com/cloud-computing/cloud-computing-3.htm)<br>
Pada website ini akan menjelaskan macam-macam cloud coumputing yaitu cloud coumputing services dan cloud operating system beserta pengertiannya.

4. [The 10 Operating System Concepts Software Developers Need to Remember](https://medium.com/cracking-the-data-science-interview/the-10-operating-system-concepts-software-developers-need-to-remember-480d0734d710)<br>
Artikel ini mmenjelaskan tentang 10 konsep tentang sistem operasi yang harus diingat oleh software developers. Di antaranya yaitu Processes and Process Management, Threads and Concurrency, Scheduling, Memory Management, Inter-Process Communication, I/O Management, Virtualization, Distributed File Systems, Distributed Shared Memory, dan Cloud Computing.

5. [Difference between dispatcher and scheduler](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-dispatcher-and-scheduler/)<br>
**Schedulers** are special system software which handle process scheduling in various ways. Their main task is to select the jobs to be submitted into the system and to decide which process to run. A **dispatcher** is a special program which comes into play after the scheduler. When the scheduler completes its job of selecting a process, it is the dispatcher which takes that process to the desired state/queue. The dispatcher is the module that gives a process control over the CPU after it has been selected by the short-term scheduler.

6. [Stack allocation vs heap allocation – performance benchmark](https://publicwork.wordpress.com/2019/06/27/stack-allocation-vs-heap-allocation-performance-benchmark/)<br>
Artikel ini menjelaskan tentang perbandingan antara Stack dan Heap Allocation dengan jenis tes yaitu :
    * Using gcc -O1 optimizations, heap vs stack with out data init.
    * Using gcc -O1 optimizations, heap vs stack with data init.
    * Using gcc -O2 optimizations, heap vs stack with out data init.
    * Using gcc -O2 optimizations, heap vs stack with data init.

7. [GNU bison](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/)<br>
Bison is a general-purpose parser generator that converts an annotated context-free grammar into a deterministic LR or generalized LR (GLR) parser employing LALR(1) parser tables. As an experimental feature, Bison can also generate IELR(1) or canonical LR(1) parser tables. Once you are proficient with Bison, you can use it to develop a wide range of language parsers, from those used in simple desk calculators to complex programming languages.

8. [gawk command in Linux](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gawk-command-in-linux-with-examples/)<br>
gawk command in Linux is used for pattern scanning and processing language. The awk command requires no compiling and allows the user to use variables, numeric functions, string functions, and logical operators.

9. [8 Linux ‘Parted’ Commands to Create, Resize and Rescue Disk Partitions](https://www.tecmint.com/parted-command-to-create-resize-rescue-linux-disk-partitions/)<br>
Parted is a famous command line tool that allows you to easily manage hard disk partitions. It can help you add, delete, shrink and extend disk partitions along with the file systems located on them. Parted has gone a long way from when it first came out. Some of it’s functions have been removed, others have been added.
* * *
10. [Chown Command in Linux (File Ownership)](https://linuxize.com/post/linux-chown-command/)<br>
The chown command allows you to change the user and/or group ownership of a given file, directory, or symbolic link.
