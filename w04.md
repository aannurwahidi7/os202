# Top 10 List of Week 04

1. [Different between C and C++](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-c-and-c/)<br>
Website ini menjelaskan tentang perbedaan antara C and C++ beserta kesamaannya.

2. [Paging in OS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/paging-in-operating-system/)<br>
Paging is a memory management scheme that eliminates the need for contiguous allocation of physical memory.

3. [How to Write and Run a C Program in Linux](https://vitux.com/how-to-write-and-run-a-c-program-in-linux/)<br>
Linux is becoming programming heaven for developers, being an open-source and free operating system. Turbo C compiler is already an old approach to compile programs so let us programmers move to Linux for a new programming environment. In this article, we will explain how to write, compile, and run a simple C program. This will serve as a basis for you to move to more complicated and useful C programs that you can write and execute on Linux.

4. [Logical vs Primary Partition](https://www.easeus.com/partition-master/logical-vs-primary.html)<br>
Primary Partition is the hard disk partition where both Windows OS and other data can be stored, and it is the only partition that can be set active for BIOS to locate. In other words, you can only boot from a primary partition. <br>
The logical partition is also called LPAR, it is a logical segmentation of a mainframe's memory and other resources that allows it to run its own copy of the operating system and associated applications. The number of logical partitions in an MBR disk is limitless.

5. [Top 10 Library Management for Linux](https://www.ubuntupit.com/best-library-management-software-for-linux/)<br>
Library management software refers to a modern and flexible system that enables maintaining the database for operating a library efficiently. It lets users manage and access various library resources through an automated system. Linux includes a wide range of applications for maintaining books and records smartly.
* * *
6. [What is a Makefile and how does it work?](https://opensource.com/article/18/8/what-how-makefile)<br>
If you want to run or update a task when certain files are updated, the make utility can come in handy. The make utility requires a file, Makefile (or makefile), which defines set of tasks to be executed. You may have used make to compile a program from source code. Most open source projects use make to compile a final executable binary, which can then be installed using make install.

7. [5 Important Jobs Your Operating System Handles Without You Knowing](https://computer.howstuffworks.com/5-important-operating-system-jobs.htm)<br>
We all know that a computer's operating system (OS) is important. Some people become loyal supporters of one operating system over all others. A few may go further and enter the realm of the fanboy -- anyone who thinks the fanboy's operating system isn't clearly superior to all others must be an idiot.
* * *
8. [How RAM Works](https://computer.howstuffworks.com/ram.htm)<br>
Random access memory (RAM) is the best known form of computer memory. RAM is considered "random access" because you can access any memory cell directly if you know the row and column that intersect at that cell.
* * *
9. [How BIOS Works](https://computer.howstuffworks.com/bios.htm)<br>
One of the most common uses of Flash memory is for the basic input/output system of your computer, commonly known as the BIOS (pronounced "bye-ose"). On virtually every computer available, the BIOS makes sure all the other chips, hard drives, ports and CPU function together.
* * *
10. [How PCs Works](https://computer.howstuffworks.com/pc.htm)<br>
The word computer refers to an object that can accept some input and produce some output. In fact, the human brain itself is a sophisticated computer, and scientists are learning more about how it works with each passing year. Our most common use of the word computer, though, is to describe an electronic device containing a microprocessor.
