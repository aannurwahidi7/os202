# Top 10 List of Week 01

1. [OSP4diss](https://osp4diss.vlsm.org/)<br>
Website ini berisi tentang tutorial-tutorial yang diperlukan dalam pembelajaran OS
* * *
2. [GitHub cbkadal](https://github.com/cbkadal/os202/)<br>
cbkadal merupakan contoh akun github yang juga bermanfaat untuk tutorial OS
* * *
3. [Virtual Memory in OS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-memory-in-operating-system/)<br>
Virtual Memory is a storage allocation scheme in which secondary memory can be addressed as though it were part of main memory. The addresses a program may use to reference memory are distinguished from the addresses the memory system uses to identify physical storage sites, and program generated addresses are translated automatically to the corresponding machine addresses.
* * *
4. [Concurrency](https://web.mit.edu/6.005/www/fa14/classes/17-concurrency/#:~:text=Concurrency%20means%20multiple%20computations%20are,cores%20on%20a%20single%20chip))<br>
Concurrency means multiple computations are happening at the same time. Concurrency is everywhere in modern programming, whether we like it or not:
- Multiple computers in a network
- Multiple applications running on one computer
- Multiple processors in a computer (today, often multiple processor cores on a single chip)
* * *
5. [Synchronization](https://study.com/academy/lesson/process-synchronization-in-operating-systems-definition-mechanisms.html)<br>
Describes about process synchronization and explains how it is managed by the operating system. It also explains the synchronization mechanisms, such as wait() and signal(), as well as semaphores and race conditions.
* * *
6. [Free Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html)<br>
“Free software” means software that respects users' freedom and community. Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software.
* * *
7. [Copyleft Software](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/copyleft.en.html#:~:text=Copyleft%20is%20a%20general%20method,in%20the%20public%20domain%2C%20uncopyrighted.)<br>
Copyleft is a general method for making a program (or other work) free (in the sense of freedom, not “zero price”), and requiring all modified and extended versions of the program to be free as well.
* * *
8. [Microkernel](https://www.guru99.com/microkernel-in-operating-systems.html#:~:text=Microkernel%20is%20a%20software%20or,functions%20of%20an%20operating%20system.)<br>
Microkernel is a software or code which contains the required minimum amount of functions, data, and features to implement an operating system. It provides a minimal number of mechanisms, which is good enough to run the most basic functions of an operating system.
* * *
9. [Operation System Service](http://www.eg.bucknell.edu/~cs315/2013-fall/sec02/notes/03-OS-Structures-print.pdf)<br>
Presentation about Operation System Service
* * *
10. [Loadable Kernel Modules](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/advantages-of-using-loadable-kernel-modules)<br>
Loadable kernel modules in an operating system is an object file that contains code to extend the running kernel, which is also known as the base kernel. The loadable kernel modules are used to add support for file systems, hardware, system calls etc.
