# Top 10 List of Week 05

1. [Techniques to handle Thrashing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/techniques-to-handle-thrashing/)<br>
Thrashing is a condition or a situation when the system is spending a major portion of its time in servicing the page faults, but the actual processing done is very negligible.

2. [What is the difference between SDRAM, DDR1, DDR2, DDR3 and DDR4?](https://www.transcend-info.com/Support/FAQ-296)<br>
Website ini merupakan penjelasan tentang perbedaan macam-macam jenis dari RAM
* * *
3. [Different Levels of Write Read Lock](https://stmatengss.github.io/blog/2017/12/17/Different-Levels-of-Write-Read-Lock/)<br>
Read write lock is a synchronization technology to solve multi read and write problem. There are three priorities: Read-prefering RW lock, Write-prefering RW lock, and Unspecified priority RW locks.

4. [What is Docker?](https://opensource.com/resources/what-docker)<br>
Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. 
Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and deploy it as one package.

5. [Difference between Header file and Library](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-header-file-library/)<br>

    **Header Files** : The files that tell the compiler how to call some functionality (without knowing how the functionality actually works) are called header files. 
    They contain the function prototypes. 
    They also contain Data types and constants used with the libraries. We use #include to use these header files in programs. These files end with .h extension. <br>

    **Library** : Library is the place where the actual functionality is implemented i.e. they contain function body. <br>
    Libraries have mainly two categories :

      - Static
      - Shared or Dynamic

6. [Belajar Docker: Membuat Docker Container](https://www.hostinger.co.id/tutorial/docker-container/)<br>
Sama seperti Linux yang tidak sengaja dibuat dan dikembangkan oleh Linus Torvalds, Docker pun merupakan produk tidak sengaja oleh Solomon Hykes. 
Pada awalnya Solomon sedang mencoba mencari solusi bagi para programmer agar dapat menyediakan kode yang bisa dijalankan baik di lingkungan pengembangan maupun di lingkungan produksi. Alhasil terciptalah Docker Container.

7. [Grub vs. Systemd-boot: Which One Should You Use as the Bootloader](https://www.maketecheasier.com/grub-vs-systemd-boot/)<br>
Systemd-boot, sometimes called “systemd” and previously called “gummiboot,” is Grub’s newer competitor. On compatible EFI systems, systemd-boot can be used in place of Grub to boot the system’s operating system. 
From a high-level perspective, systemd-boot links to the bootloader already in UEFI, offering the most basic feature set for selecting an operating system. 
Grub, on the other hand, loads what is sometimes described as “an entire OS” to manage booting the user’s operating system, providing far greater capability.
* * *
8. [Difference between Hard real time and Soft real time system](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-hard-real-time-and-soft-real-time-system/)<br>
Real time system is defined as a system in which job has deadline, job has to finished by the deadline (strictly finished). If a result is delayed, huge loss may happen.
* * *
9. [Copy-on-Write](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/copy-on-write/)<br>
Copy on Write or simply COW is a resource management technique. One of its main use is in the implementation of the fork system call in which it shares the virtual memory(pages) of the OS.
* * *
10. [Page Fault Handling in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/page-fault-handling-in-operating-system/)<br>
A page fault occurs when a program attempts to access data or code that is in its address space, but is not currently located in the system RAM.
