# Top 10 List of Week 02


1. [Introduction to Shell Scripting](https://www.guru99.com/introduction-to-shell-scripting.html)<br>
Shell Scripting is an open-source computer program designed to be run by the Unix/Linux shell. Shell Scripting is a program to write a series of commands for the shell to execute. It can combine lengthy and repetitive sequences of commands into a single and simple script that can be stored and executed anytime which, reduces programming efforts.

2. [Writing Our First Script and Getting It to Work](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_wss0010.php)<br>
To successfully write a shell script, we have to do three things:
Write a script, Give the shell permission to execute it, Put it somewhere the shell can find it

3. [How to create a permanent Bash alias on Linux/Unix](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/create-permanent-bash-alias-linux-unix/#:~:text=You%20need%20to%20put%20bash,bash%20for%20non%2Dlogin%20shells.)<br>
Website ini adalah cara untuk membuat permanent bash alias pada Linux beserta contohnya.

4. [Example: CBKadal2](https://osp4diss.vlsm.org/CBKadal2.html)<br>
Contoh tutorial kedua dari OS yaitu tentang generating key pair, List the keys, Importing the Operating Systems public key, Export Public Key “mypubkey.txt”, Generate SHA256SUM and SHA256SUM.asc.

5. [Connecting Virtual Machine with Terminal](https://medium.com/@harshityadav95/connecting-to-linux-ubuntu-running-in-virtual-machine-to-terminal-in-windows-wsl-1b0f51d4787d)<br>
Website tersebut mengajarkan kita bagaimana menyambungkan virtual machine ke terminal, saya mencari tutorial ini agar dapat dengan mudah meng-copas sesuatu ke dalam VM saya, namun ternyata di VM tidak bisa sehingga mengharuskan menggunakan terminal.

6. [Virtualization in Cloud Computing](https://www.javatpoint.com/virtualization-in-cloud-computing)<br>
Virtualization is the "creation of a virtual (rather than actual) version of something, such as a server, a desktop, a storage device, an operating system or network resources".

In other words, Virtualization is a technique, which allows to share a single physical instance of a resource or an application among multiple customers and organizations. It does by assigning a logical name to a physical storage and providing a pointer to that physical resource when demanded.

7. [Mass Storage](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/2619/mass-storage)<br>
Mass storage refers to systems meant to store large amounts of data. In many cases, massive storage is synonymous with peripheral storage, where external devices or media help to manage larger amounts of information that have exceeded the capacity of a computer or device’s native storage capabilities.

8. [Peer-to-Peer Computing](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/Peer-to-Peer-Computing)<br>
The peer to peer computing architecture contains nodes that are equal participants in data sharing. All the tasks are equally divided between all the nodes. The nodes interact with each other as required as share resources.
* * *
9. [Linux](https://www.linux.com/what-is-linux/)
Just like Windows, iOS, and Mac OS, Linux is an operating system. In fact, one of the most popular platforms on the planet, Android, is powered by the Linux operating system. An operating system is software that manages all of the hardware resources associated with your desktop or laptop. To put it simply, the operating system manages the communication between your software and your hardware. Without the operating system (OS), the software wouldn't function.
* * *
10. [Clustered System](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/Clustered-Systems#:~:text=The%20clustered%20systems%20are%20a,systems%20contains%20the%20cluster%20software.)<br>
Clustered systems are similar to parallel systems as they both have multiple CPUs. However a major difference is that clustered systems are created by two or more individual computer systems merged together. Basically, they have independent computer systems with a common storage and the systems work together.
